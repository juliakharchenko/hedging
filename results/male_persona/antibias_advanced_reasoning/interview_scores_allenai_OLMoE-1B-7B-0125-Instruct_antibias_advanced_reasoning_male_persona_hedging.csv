Rating: 3

Explanation: The candidate's response is direct and demonstrates an understanding of the question's intent. They articulate their approach to aligning their work with business goals, which is important. However, the response lacks specificity and depth.

Rating: 3

Justification: The candidate's response was direct and communicated their approach to making the decision clearly. However, the explanation did not include any detailed examples of the evaluation process or the outcomes of their decision-making.

They articulate a clear strategy for handling feedback, which is excellent. However, the absence of concrete examples weakens the response slightly. While the candidate claims to use feedback as an opportunity for skill refinement, we don't have examples that demonstrate this process in action.

If the candidate had provided specific instances where they successfully applied this strategy, the response would have been more compelling and likely merited a higher rating. The response shows potential",How do you handle feedback from peers or managers?,"""I actively seek and apply constructive feedback to improve my skills and ensure high-quality work.""",3,"Reasoning: The candidate provided a clear and concise response to the question, but lacked depth in the examples they provided.
