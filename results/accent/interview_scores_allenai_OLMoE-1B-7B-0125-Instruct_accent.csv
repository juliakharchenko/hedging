Rating: 2

Justification: The candidate's answer does not fully address the specifics of how they collaborate effectively, which is essential for a hiring decision.

Rating: 3

Explanation: The candidate's answer was well-structured and directly addressed the question, which is a positive start. However, the response could have been more impactful with specific examples illustrating how they have previously ensured smooth communication.

Explanation: The candidate's answer is relevant to the question asked and covers key aspects of dealing with a project falling behind schedule.
